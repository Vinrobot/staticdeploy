StaticDeploy is an open-source platform for deploying and configuring static web
applications and websites. We can think about it as a
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for static content.

StaticDeploy was created with two objectives in mind:

- make it easy to configure a static app at runtime, as opposed to injecting the
  configuration into its static build

- make it easy to deploy multiple "versions" of a static app, specifically a
  version for each branch / pull request, so that frontend developers can show
  their work-in-progress and get early feedback from their clients

Refactors:

- restructure the project to follow the
  [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
  principles
- switch to [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) (from
  [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/)) for sql operations

BREAKING CHANGES:

- the project is now distributed as the single docker image
  `staticdeploy/staticdeploy` instead of the three images
  `staticdeploy/api-server`, `staticdeploy/static-server`, and
  `staticdeploy/admin-console`
- the `staticdeploy/staticdeploy` image requires a slightly different
  configuration than the previous three images. Refer to
  [the documentation](https://staticdeploy.io/_/v0.12.0/docs/guides-deploying-staticdeploy-with-docker)
  for details
- SQLite is not supported anymore as a databse
- due to the SQL migrations library having changed, a _migration of the saved
  migrations_ must be done manually on existing PostgreSQL databases. If you're
  in this situation, open an issue asking for support

## 0.8.0 (June 19, 2018)

BREAKING CHANGES:

- bundles must now specify a fallback asset, that will be served to requests not
  matching any other asset. The fallback asset used to be statically set to
  `/index.html`, even for bundles not having an `/index.html` asset. Now it must
  be specified at bundle creation time (note: the StaticDeploy **cli** defaults
  it to `/index.html` if the asset exists in the bundle being created). For
  bundles created with StaticDeploy <= 0.7.0, SQL migrations set the fallback
  asset to `/index.html`. If those bundles don't contain the asset, requesting
  it will result in a 500 HTTP error (with StaticDeploy <= 0.7.0 it would have
  been a 404). The decision to let a 500 slip instead of handling the error and
  responding with a more correct 404 was made because handling the special case
  would have complicated the already complex routing algorithm, and because
  actually we don't expect there to be any such cases deployed

- routing algorithm changes:
  - when serving a bundle containing assets `/path` and `/path.html`, requests
    for `/path` will get the `/path` asset, not the `/path.html` asset (used to
    be the other way around)
  - when serving a bundle containing assets `/path.html` and `/path/index.html`,
    requests for `/path` will get the `/path.html` asset, not the
    `/path/index.html` asset (used to be the other way around)

Features:

- fallback asset for bundles (see breaking change)
- improved routing algorithm (see breaking change)

## 0.7.0 (June 2, 2018)

BREAKING CHANGES:

- using the local filesystem to store static content is no longer supported

Features:

- also support PostgreSQL as SQL database
- use S3 (and API-compatible object storage services) for storing static files
